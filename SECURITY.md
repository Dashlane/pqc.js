This project is an experiment, and we do not make any security claims about the code included and generated.
As in PQClean, we distribute the reference implementations with minor modifications. We did not perform any extensive
security analyses. The generated bindings are suitable for experimental or scientific use. We recommend careful expert
code review before any use in production environments.
